# claude wrote it - I just gave it the test cases. (Claude Projects are vv nice, I am gonna go see how to break it heh)

a simple ~static~ blog generator

- reads markdown from a github repo
- generates a blog
- rendered dynamically on the client side
- SPA, but no permalinks yet
- Maybe I make a static blog generator later
- I wouldn't suggest using it
